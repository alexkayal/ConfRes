You are participating in an experiment for research purposes.

The experiment is about creating agreements for sharing location.

This experiment is divided into several parts, and takes approximately 20 minutes to complete.

In each part, a number of scenarios will be displayed, regarding a family life situation.

It is assumed that the characters in the scenario are in possession of a mobile device with a location sharing app. 

With that app, one can check-in at certain locations, share that check-in with others, and make agreements with other people.

Each scenario stops at a specific problem. 

In these scenarios you assume the role of an 8-year old primary school child, where your task is to construct an agreement, attempting to solve that problem, using a menu just like the agreement menu of the app. 

Every time you create an agreement, you will be asked to indicate, from the perspective of your character in the scenario, how you believe the agreement supports specific human values.

The scenarios have been designed so that sometimes, conflicts between agreements will occur.

Of course, a system may not be able to comply with all agreements at the same time. 

For this reason you will be asked, from the perspective of your character in the scenario, to indicate how much you favor one agreement over the other.

When you are ready, please click the start button. By doing so, you agree to our terms and conditions, which you can view beforehand. 

After that, you will be shown one example task page to help you practice. This will not count in the experiment.
